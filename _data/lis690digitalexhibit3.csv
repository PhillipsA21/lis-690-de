sf1,williamfostertherailroadporter.jpg,,William D. Foster,image/jpeg,"William D. Foster (1860-1940) was a late 19th- early 20th-century film producer. In 1910, he founded the first African American production company in Chicago, Illinois, the Foster Photoplay Company. Foster wanted to challenge the negative images of African Americans so often seen in films made by white film producers. The Foster Photoplay Company produced The Railroad Porter (1913), which is believed to be the first film made with an all Black cast and director. Aiming to bring positive Black representation on screen to filmgoers, Williams Foster steadily produced several more films through his production company before closing in 1917.

sf2,byrightofbirthvideo2.mp4,,"By Right of Birth (embedded clip, The Trooper with Troop K)",video/mp4	,"The Lincoln Motion Picture Company was founded by brothers Noble Johnson (1881-1978) and George Perry Johnson (1885-1977) in 1916 in Omaha, Nebraska. The company moved to Los Angeles, California, shortly afterward. Like their predecessor, William D. Foster, the Johson brothers, wanted to create moving pictures specifically for Black audiences. They produced five films, which included ""The Realization of a Negro's Ambition"" (1916), ""The Law of Nature"" (1916), ""The Trooper of Company K"" (1917), ""A Man's Duty"" (1919), and ""By Right of Birth"" (1921). ""By Right of Birth"" was the last film produced before operations ceased shortly afterward. 

All films produced by The Lincoln Motion Picture were thought to be lost except for pieces of ""By Right of Birth."" However, in 2022, a professor at Indiana University in Bloomington, Cara Caddoo, solved a strange occurrence that happens in the film ""By Right of Birth."" The total length of the film is about four minutes long. Around the 2:28 mark of the film, a 15-second clip of another movie can be seen in the top left corner of the picture. The phantom clip was a mystery until Cara Caddoo recognized Noble Johnson. Noble Johnson, Caddoo learned, was in the film ""The Trooper of Company K."" A fragment of the film ""The Trooper of Company K,"" thought lost forever, was superimposed in ""By Right of Birth."" 

In this 30-second clip from ""By Right of Birth,"" the superimposed fragments from ""The Trooper of Company K"" can be seen 2 seconds into the clip.
