sf1,williamfostertherailroadporter.jpg,,William D. Foster,image/jpeg,William D. Foster (1860-1940) was a late 19th- early 20th-century film producer. In 1910, he founded the first African American production company in Chicago, Illinois, the Foster Photoplay Company. Foster wanted to challenge the negative images of African Americans so often seen in films made by white film producers. The Foster Photoplay Company produced The Railroad Porter (1913), which is believed to be the first film made with an all Black cast and director. Aiming to bring positive Black representation on screen to filmgoers, Williams Foster steadily produced several more films through his production company before closing in 1917.,,,,,Image,,,,,normanstudios.org,,,https://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NKC/1.0/,,Image,eng,Norman Studios Online Musuem
